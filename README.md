# FLAMESFramework

[FLAMESÂ®](https://flamesframework.com) is a family of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software products that provide a framework for custom constructive and virtual simulations and interfaces between live, virtual and constructive (LVC) simulations.

The FLAMESFramework GitHub organization maintains the repositories that contain the source code to the FLAMES plug-ins and example applications that are available in binary form in the [FLAMES Store](https://store.flamesframework.com). You can fork and clone the repositories to modify or create new plug-ins and applications and develop your own custom, FLAMES-based simulations. Most of the repositories are private.
